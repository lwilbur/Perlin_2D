# Perlin_2D
## Purpose
This Java implementation of 2D Perlin Noise has two purposes:
1. To provide a freely available and reusable 2D implementation of Perlin Noise, since most implementations assume a 3D implementation.
2. To provide an example of Perlin Noise which others can easily understand and learn from. To this end, this code features extensive documentation and commenting, intended to be understandable even to those with minimal prior knowledge of Perlin Noise.
